# Notes  
Baskin, C. C., & Baskin, J. M. (2004). Germinating seeds of wildflowers, an ecological perspective. HortTechnology, 14(4), 467-473.

CD dormancy is very similar to nondormancy. May be more important to say species that CAN be nondormant
Same with combination PY and PD (Trifolium). May be more important to say species HAS physical dormancy.

Whats the diffference in terms of evenness among plants constituting the dormancy classes. In other words, are different physical dormancy species popping up in different sites while PD is constituted by few dominant species?

Species including PD (MPD) are PD [have physiological components]
Species including some degree of PY are PY [have physical capabilities]
Species including ND are ND [have non dormant capabilities]

### Eriogonum longifolium [ND]

Eriogonum species can be physiological dormant or non-dormant. In the study below, the seeds were collected and sown within two weeks; those seeds germinated within two weeks. That sounds like a nondormant seed, but the physiological change may have occured within that period.
